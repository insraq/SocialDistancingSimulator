This game can be modded by tweaking the game parameters. To override an parameter, add it to URL. For example:

fishpondstudio.com/ld46?familyCount=25&incubationDay=5

will override `familyCount` to 25 and `incubationDay` to 5. You can share this URL so that other people will play your modded version.

hospitalCapacity: 0.05
// Total capacity of hospital w.r.t population. e.g. If population = 100 and hospitalCapacity = 0.05, then 0.05 * 100 (= 5) is the capacity of hospital

incubationDay: 3
// On average the incubation period

asymptomaticPencentage: 0.5

recoverDaysNeeded: 5
// On average the number of days needed for recovery

seriousRecoverDaysMultiplier: 2
// On average the number of days needed for serious infection recovery w.r.t `recoverDaysNeeded`. 2 means it needs twice the time (i.e. 10 days)
